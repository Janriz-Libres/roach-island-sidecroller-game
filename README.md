    <p>
      An endless side-scrolling game where your only objective is to terminate as many roaches (They're the same size as you! Yikes!) as possible until you run out of health, fall to your demise, or went out from the boundaries of the game screen.

## Instructions
You can use the WASD keys to move and jump, the 'J' key to shoot, and 'space' to change the direction you're facing, which changes the trajectory of your bullets.

You only have 3 lives, and every damage you take will cost you one life. However, if you fall, it'll be game over instantly! 3 hits are all that it takes! But don't worry, the roaches aren't as hostile as they might seem. They won't chase you when they see you, but you have to be careful where you land! Because there are lots and lots of them!

There are two ways to kill your enemies: One is to shoot them. Second is to jump on top of them, similar to the original Super Mario game. The former applies a knockback to the enemy, while the latter is useful for traversing across the sea of mobs!

The roaches will spawn at random locations at any given time, even when you have just first spawned and started the game, so always be alert!
